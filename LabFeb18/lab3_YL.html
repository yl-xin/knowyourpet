            <p>Chongqing is my hometown which is located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in southwestern China. It's very beaustiful. It's famous for its hot weather and hot food.</p>
            <p>Chongqing was a municipality during the Republic of China (ROC) administration, serving as its wartime capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). The current municipality was recreated on 14 March 1997 to help develop the central and western parts of China. It's the best place in the world.</p>
